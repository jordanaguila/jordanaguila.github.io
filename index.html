									<h2>Introduction to me</h2>
									<p>Hi, my name is Jordan and I live in Ballarat, Victoria I was born in Australia and spent most of my life in the inner
										 western suburbs until recently. My background is half Chilean and half Spanish, and I would love to learn Spanish the only
										 language I know is English. I have studied up to year 12 and competed my VCE I went straight into university studying a
										 Bachelor of Info tech with RMIT I ended up leaving due to personal circumstances so now Iâ€™m back to finish what I started.
										 In terms of Info tech, I am extremely interested in programming and studied JAVA all though year 11 and 12 and still program
										 in my spare time for fun. I also love to play the guitar and music is one of my biggest passions. </p>

									<h2>What sparked my intrest in IT</h2>
									<p>My interest in info tech probably started when I was around 12, I remember finding YouTube and constantly watching
										 info tech creators specifically about building PCs is where it started and from there my interest continued to grow.
										  Throughout high school I studied anything involving technology or mathematics and the last years of high school is when
											 I got taught Java and from there I used to code for fun and constantly teach myself whatever I could about Java.</p>
