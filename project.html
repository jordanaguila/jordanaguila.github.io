							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>The project I would like to develop is a mobile app designed to make smart home integration easier and more fluid in my
								experience smart home products have come a long way but there is still so many way different company’s intergrade these
								technology’s into our homes I would like to create an app that not only linked all of your smart home devices in one place
								but also gave smart suggestions on what possible automations you would be able to create with multiple smart devices across
								multiple platforms and brands.</p>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>There is ever increasing smart home products being released daily and more and more consumers buying into this market.
								For a lot of people smart home technology is still new and not knowing the different eco systems these products are based
								 around can lead to confusion when improper research has been done on a product. With a universal solution people wouldn’t
								  have to think before they buy anymore, they would know that any product they buy would be able to be added to their smart
									home eco system without worry.</p>
