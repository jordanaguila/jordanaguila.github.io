							<h1 class="major">Project Idea</h1>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>The project I would like to develop is a mobile app designed to make smart home integration easier and more fluid in my
								experience smart home products have come a long way but there is still so many way different company’s intergrade these
								technology’s into our homes I would like to create an app that not only linked all of your smart home devices in one place
								but also gave smart suggestions on what possible automations you would be able to create with multiple smart devices across
								multiple platforms and brands.</p>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>There is ever increasing smart home products being released daily and more and more consumers buying into this market.
								For a lot of people smart home technology is still new and not knowing the different eco systems these products are based
								 around can lead to confusion when improper research has been done on a product. With a universal solution people wouldn’t
								  have to think before they buy anymore, they would know that any product they buy would be able to be added to their smart
									home eco system without worry.</p>
							<h2>Project Description</h2>
							<p>This app would make smart home control easier and simpler than ever the days of worrying if you have brought the right globes
								 to match the rest of the house or having to switch apps to turn on you central heating. This app will be able to control all the
								  smart devices in your house without worry it will be able to detect and add new devices and have your whole house neatly
									organised in one app. With control of all your devices in one place you will be able to have more control than ever you will
									also be able to setup automations which while simultaneously trigger one or multiple devices when select criteria have
									been met such as turning off you lights and turning on your vacuum  when you head off to work no only will you be able to create
									 these automations this app will also intelligently suggest new automations on your use of the app. You’ll be able to share
									 control of your home with others of the household giving them full control or only what matters to them. It’ll be easier than
									 ever to give access to your home when you need someone to house sit for example you will be able to give temporary access of
									 your home to friends or family while you’re away on holidays rather than handing out keys or passwords you’ll be able to give
									 access to as little or as much of your home as you want to people you trust.</p>
               <h2>Tools and Software</h2>
							 <p>The programming language that I will most likely have to program this in swift(IOS) and Kotlin(Android) I will also need
								 access to API’s for all major smart home devices to be able to integrate all smart home devices.</p>
							 <h2>Skill</h2>
							 <p>The skills required for this project would mainly be being able to code in these two languages. The software required
								 for these languages is all free to use with both google and apple having courses that can be studied to learn these languages.
								 Coding these however would take someone with a good knowledge of coding mobile apps.</p>
							 <h2>Outcome</h2>
							 <p>If this project is successful, it will make smart home technology more open to the public and easier to get started with and
								  use. It will solve the confusion that many people face when trying to start investing in smart home technology. </p>
